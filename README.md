# ArchUpdateChecker
A small wrapper around pacman for Arch Linux that prompts the user when updates are available.

Requirements:
* Python 3.6+
* GTK 3
* PyGObject
* GNU wc
* pacman package manager
* A bash like default shell

To run, execute auc.py as root, or using sudo/gksudo. If not ran as root erronious behaviour may occur.
